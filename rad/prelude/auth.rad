(def make-simple-auth
  "Creates an authorization scheme with any number of groups of users.

  Example:

    (def auth (make-simple-auth [:admin])) ;; creates auth with initial 'admin group'
    (auth [:add-to :admin \"alice\"]) ;; adds alice to admin
    (auth [:is-in :admin \"alice\"]) :: #t
    (auth [:create-group :regular]) ;; creates 'regular' group

  A common pattern is to set up a machine, and only then set the owner of the
  machine. Since setting the owner is something only owners can do, we provide
  a way for *initializing* the authentication mechanism. Prior to
  initialization, `(auth [:allowed <group> <person>])` always succeeds.
  After `(auth [:initialize])` is called, it returns whatever
  `(auth [:is-in <group> <person>])` returns.
