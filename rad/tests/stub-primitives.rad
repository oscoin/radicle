;; This script stubs some primitives for code evaluated afterwards.
;;
;; This code is used by `rad/tests/run.rad` to test code that relies on
;; primitives. Currently only some primitives are stubbed.
;;
;; A primitive `prim` is stubbed by creating a ref `primitive-stub-ref/prim`
;; that holds the original primitive value. The function `prim` is then
;; redefined as calling the function stored in the reference.
;;
;; See `prelude/machine/install-remote-machine-fake` for how to use primitve stubs.
