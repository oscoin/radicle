# Basics

Though `radicle` is designed with a particular use-case in mind--namely,
defining and interacting with decentralised state machines--it is ultimately a
general purpose language, quite similar to
[Scheme](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29) or
[Clojure](clojure.org/). To effectively use it, it is helpful to learn the
basics of it independent of its application.

This chapter introduces `radicle` as a language. In each section we present
a core datatype of the language, and show some basic operations that can be
performed on them.

## Namespaces

All code lives in some namespace. Let's make one just for this tutorial.

```radicle
(ns basics-tutorial)
```

Namespaces can require symbols from other namespaces. We'll take all the
definitions we need for this tutorial now:

```radicle
(require prelude.basic '[or if])
(require prelude.bool '[and])
```

## Comments

The string `;;` starts a comment. This comments all the text until the next
line-break. In this guide we will often add a comment as follows:

```radicle
(+ 1 1) ;; ==> 2
```

to indicate that an expression (in this case `(+ 1 1)`) evaluates to a specific
value (in this case `2`).

## Built-in datatypes

`radicle` supports the following datatypes:

### Booleans

The literal syntax for booleans is `#t` for true, and `#f` for false. Booleans can be combined with `and` and `or`:

```radicle
(and #t #f) ;; ==> #f
(or  #t #f) ;; ==> #t
```

### Strings

Strings are enclosed in double quotes:

```radicle
"this is a string"
```

### Keywords

Keywords are identifiers that evaluate to themselves. To create a keyword you
prefix `:` onto an identifier (`:foo` is a keyword, for example). Keywords are
often used as keys in maps which act like records in other languages. The colon
at the front is a prefix form of the colon that follows the name of a field in
other languages. For example, `{name: "foo", age: 22}` in JavaScript becomes
`{:name "foo" :age 22}` in Radicle.

```radicle
:foo ;; ==> :foo
```

## Atoms

Atoms are identifiers which, when evaluated, lookup the value bound to that
identifier in the current environment:

```radicle
(def foo 42)

foo ;; ==> 42
```

### Vectors

`radicle`'s *vectors* are an array-like container for values. Literal notation
for vectors uses square brackets:

```radicle
["this" "is" "a" "vector"]
```

You can access any of the elements in the vector using `nth`:

```radicle
(nth 2 ["start at zero!" "one" "two" "three"]) ;; ==> "two"
```

But be careful: if the size of the argument isn't less than (`<`) the size of the
vector then this will result in an error.

Concatenate vectors using `<>`:

```radicle
(<> [1 2 3] [4 5 6]) ;; ==> [1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

Add an element to the left using `cons`:

```radicle
(cons 0 [1 2 3]) ;; ==> [0 1 2 3]
```

Add an element to the right using `add-right`:

```radicle
(add-right 3 [0 1 2]) ;; ==> [0 1 2 3]
```

### Lists

Lists are one of the fundamental data structures of functional programming. Just
like vectors are enclosed in square brackets, lists are enclosed in parentheses.

However, as you may have noticed, parentheses are also used for function
application. This is because lists are the representation for *code* that
evaluates to the result of applying the first element of the list to the
other elements.

Don't worry if this is still a little unclear; we will discuss it at greater
length when we talk about evaluation and quotation. For now, what this in
practice means is that if you want to create a list, you can use the
function `list` on the elements you want in the list.  You can also use
`list-from-vec` to make a vector into a list.

You can prepend an element to a list with `cons`:

```radicle
(cons 0 (list 1)) ;; ==> (0 1)
```

Retrieve the first item of a list with `first`:

```radicle
(first (list 0 1 2 3)) ;; ==> 0
```

The rest of it with `rest`:

```radicle
(rest (list 0 1 2 3)) ;; ==> (1 2 3)
```

Or a specific index with `nth`:

```radicle
(nth 2 (list 0 1 2 3)) ;; ==> 2
```

### Lists or vectors?

Vectors differ from lists in a couple of important ways. First, lists are
implemented as linked lists, and accessing the `nth` element of a list has
linear time complexity on `n` (the function `nth` works for both vectors and
lists). Additionally, appending to the end of a list is also linear.  Vectors,
on the other hand, allow for faster (logarithmic) indexed access and appending
(constant time).

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are mappings between keys and values. (You may know them as maps,
associative arrays, or symbol tables.) Literal syntax for dictionaries is
formed by including the keys and values inside curly braces:

```radicle
{ :key1 1
  :key2 "foo"
}
```

It is an error to have an odd number of elements inside the braces.

Keys may be any value, including other dictionaries:

```radicle
{ :key1 1
  { :nested "foo" } "bar"
}
```

You can access the value associated with a key with the function `lookup`:

```radicle
(lookup :key1 { :key1 1 }) ;; ==> 1
```

And add new values with `insert`:

```radicle
(insert :key2 2 { :key1 1 }) ;; ==> { :key1 1 :key2 2 }
```

## Simple expressions

### Branching

To dispatch on a boolean value use `if`:

```radicle
(def num-bugs 50)

(if (> num-bugs 0)
  "Oh no, so many bugs!"
  "All done!")
```

To test multiple booleans use `cond`:

```radicle
(cond
  (> num-bugs 100) "Oh no, so many bugs!"
  (eq? num-bugs 0)   "All done!"
  #t               "A few bugs.")
```

In fact _all_ values which are not `#f` are treated as true, so one can also
write:

```radicle
(cond
  (> num-bugs 100) "Oh no, so many bugs!"
  (eq? num-bugs 0)   "All done!"
  :else              "A few bugs.")
```

If none of the conditions in the `cond` are true then the result is an error!

### Function application

A function call takes prefixed, parenthesized form. That is, the call appears
within parenthesis, with the function at the head, followed by its arguments:

```radicle
(+ 3 2) ;; => 5
```

### Definitions

Definitions bind values to an identifier.

```radicle
(def five 5)
five ;; ==> 5
```

### Functions

A function is created using `fn`. The first argument is a vector of symbols
representing the parameters of the function, and the rest is a sequence of
expressions which are run when the function is called.

So a function which adds one to a number can be defined like so:
```radicle
(fn [x] (+ x 1))
```

You can call it like any other function:
```radicle
((fn [x] (+ x 1)) 1) ;; ==> 2
```

But most likely you want to `def`ine a new variable:
```radicle
(def f (fn [x] (+ x 1)))

(f 41) ;; ==> 42
```

Functions can be recursive:

```radicle
(def range
 (fn [from to]
  (if (<= to from)
    (list)
    (cons from (range (+ 1 from) to)))))
```

Note that `def-rec` may only be used to define functions.

For creating one-off anonymous functions quickly, there is a short-form. This is
formed by a `\` character (meant to look like the main stroke of a Î») and then a
valid radicle expression, which will be the return value of the function. To
make a single parameter function use `?` for the argument. To make a
multi-parameter function, use `?1`, `?2`, etc. Here are some examples of
short-form lambdas and the long-form equivalent:

```radicle
;; The identity function.
\?
(fn [x] x)

;; Partial application:
\(foo 0 ?)
(fn [x] (foo 0 x))

;; A function to make singleton vectors:
\[?]
(fn [x] [x])

;; Multiple arguments:
\(string-append ?1 " is the parent of " ?2)
(fn [x y] (string-append x " is the parent of " y))

;; Thunks:
\(put-str! "hello there!")
(fn [] (put-str! "hello there"))
```

Note that:
- Only `?1`, `?2`, ..., `?9` are allowed for positional arguments. If you want
  more that 9 parameters please seek professional help.
- Short-form lambdas cannot be nested.
- You cannot use a mixture of `?` and `?1`, `?2`, etc. inside a short-form
  lambda.
- To avoid hard to detect bugs, atoms starting with a `?` followed by a sequence
  of digits that isn't one of the allowed positional atoms will cause an error.
