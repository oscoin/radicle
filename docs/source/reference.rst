Given a value ``k`` (the 'key') and a dict ``d``, returns the value
associated with ``k`` in ``d``. If the key does not exist in ``d`` then
``()`` is returned instead. If ``d`` is not a dict then an exception is
thrown.

``insert``
~~~~~~~~~~

Given ``k``, ``v`` and a dict ``d``, returns a dict with the same
associations as ``d`` but with ``k`` associated to ``d``. If ``d`` isn't
a dict or if ``k`` isn't hashable then an exception is thrown.

``delete``

Given ``k`` and a dict ``d``, returns a dict with the same associations
as ``d`` but without the key ``k``. If ``d`` isn't a dict then an
exception is thrown.

``map-keys``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Structures
----------

Functions for manipulating lists, vectors and dicts.

``member?``
~~~~~~~~~~~

Given ``v`` and structure ``s``, checks if ``x`` exists in ``s``. The
structure ``s`` may be a list, vector or dict. If it is a list or a
vector, it checks if ``v`` is one of the items. If ``s`` is a dict, it
checks if ``v`` is one of the keys.

Patterns
--------

Pattern matching is first-class in radicle so new patterns can easily be
defined. These are the most essential.

``(match-pat pat v)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pattern matching dispatch function. This function defines how
patterns are treated in ``match`` expressions. Atoms are treated as
bindings. Numbers, keywords and strings are constant patterns. Dicts of
patterns match dicts whose values at those keys match those patterns.
Vectors of patterns match vectors of the same length, pairing the
patterns and elements by index.

``(_ v)``
~~~~~~~~~

The wildcard pattern.

``(/? p)``
~~~~~~~~~~

Predicate pattern. Takes a predicate function as argument. Values match
against this pattern if the predicate returns a truthy value.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Empty-list pattern.

``(/cons x-pat xs-pat)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A pattern for lists with a head and a tail.

``(/as var pat)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As pattern. Takes a variable and a sub-pattern. If the subpattern
matches then the whole pattern matches and furthermore the variable is
bound to the matched value.

Refs
----

``ref``
~~~~~~~

Creates a ref with the argument as the initial value.

``read-ref``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns the current value of a ref.

``write-ref``

Given a reference ``r`` and a value ``v``, updates the value stored in
``r`` to be ``v`` and returns ``v``.

``(modify-ref r f)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify 'ref' by applying the provided function. Returns the new value.

Evaluation functions
--------------------

Utilities for creating and extending evaluation functions.

``base-eval``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default evaluation function. Expects an expression and a radicle
state. Return a list of length 2 consisting of the result of the
evaluation and the new state.

``(eval expr env)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An eval in which one can use ``(:enter-chain url)`` to make the eval
behave as that of a remote chain, and ``:send`` to send all enqueued
expressions.

``(updatable-eval sub-eval)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given an evaluation function ``f``, returns a new one which augments
``f`` with a new command ``(update expr)`` which evaluates arbitrary
expression using ``base-eval``.

Documentation and testing
-------------------------

Functions for creating and querying documentation of variables in scope,
and testing functions.

``(help)``
~~~~~~~~~~

Default help text.

``doc``
~~~~~~~
