the prelude has been loaded.

Basics
------

Basic function used for checking equality, determining the type of a
value, etc.

``eq?``
~~~~~~~

Checks if two values are equal.

``not``

``:atom``, ``:keyword``, ``:string``, ``:number``, ``:boolean``,
``:list``, ``:vector``, ``:function``, ``:dict``, ``:ref``,
``:function``.

``atom?``

and repetitively combining values with ``f``, using elements of ``xs``
from left to right.

``foldr``
~~~~~~~~~

Given a function ``f``, an initial value ``i`` and a sequence (list or

returned without modification while for dicts a vector of
key-value-pairs is returned: these are vectors of length 2 whose first
item is a key and whose second item is the associated value.

``()`` is returned instead. If ``d`` is not a dict then an exception is
thrown.

``insert``
~~~~~~~~~~

associations as ``d`` but with ``k`` associated to ``d``. If ``d`` isn't
a dict then an exception is thrown.

as ``d`` but without the key ``k``. If ``d`` isn't a dict then an
exception is thrown.

already exists, it is overwritten.

``map-values``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a function ``f`` and a dict ``d``, returns a dict with the same
keys as ``d`` but ``f`` applied to all the associated values.

``modify-map``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

associated to that key.

Structures
----------

Functions for manipulating lists, vectors and dicts.

``member?``
~~~~~~~~~~~

Given ``v`` and structure ``s``, checks if ``x`` exists in ``s``. The
structure ``s`` may be a list, vector or dict. If it is a list or a
