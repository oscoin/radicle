     list         - Lists all patches
                    The list can be filtered by state:
                      " (string/intercalate ", " valid-states) "
                    The flags for filtering by state:
                      " (string/intercalate ", " status-opts) "
                    Filtering by multiple states is possible via '-s <state1> -s
                    <state2> ...'.
                    If the option '--fancy' is appended, the list is opened via
                    fzf (note that fzf has to be installed).
                    Unread patches are marked with a * before the timestamp.
     propose      - Create a new patch from a single commit
     show         - Show a patch
     comment      - Add a comment to a patch
     retract      - Retract your own patch
                    This command is restricted to the creator of the patch or the
                    maintainer of the project.
     accept       - Accept a patch
                    Automatically merges to master and pushes to origin. This
                    command is restricted to the maintainer of the project.
     checkout     - Checkout a patch locally
                    Creates a new branch 'patch/<patch-number>' and applies the
                    patch to it.
     reject       - Reject a patch
                    This command is restricted to the maintainer of the project.
