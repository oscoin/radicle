     list         - Lists all patches
                    The list can be filtered by state:
                      " (string/intercalate ", " valid-states) "
                    The flags for filtering by state:
                      " (string/intercalate ", " status-opts) "
                    Filtering by multiple states is possible via '-s <state1> -s
                    <state2> ...'.
                    If the option '--fancy' is appended, the list is opened via
                    fzf (note that fzf has to be installed).
